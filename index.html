The workshop encouraged students to think about the responsibility of the design, but also our responsibility as individuals. It empowered participants to develop their own design methods while prioritizing ethical principles centered on sustainability and well-being. Use these tools however you want – to become a better designer or just to survive in this cold world</div>
